## Calcul des priorités
scoreboard players set @s[predicate=uhc:id_team_alive] bhc.invSR 100
scoreboard players operation @s bhc.invSR -= @s bhc.CA
scoreboard players operation @s bhc.invSR -= @s bhc.CB
scoreboard players operation @s bhc.invSR *= #100 uhc.data.numbers
scoreboard players operation @s bhc.invSR += @s bhc.invStepA
scoreboard players operation @s bhc.invSR += @s bhc.invStepB
scoreboard players operation @s bhc.invSR *= #100 uhc.data.numbers
scoreboard players operation @s bhc.invSR -= @s bhc.CD

scoreboard players add @s bhc.CA 17
scoreboard players add @s bhc.CB 17
scoreboard players add @s bhc.CK 17
scoreboard players add @s bhc.CD 17

scoreboard players set @s bhc.CR -16
